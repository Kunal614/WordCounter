# WordCounter

This project was born out of the desire to not have to count words.
While preparing for job searching, I found myself writing down keywords to make sure I was putting the proper words in my resume. I got tired of counting so I made this program in **Python** to count for me.

Scan a file and count the number of times each word shows up.

## Instructions

1) Open a .txt file.
2) go to your favorite job serching site
3) copy/paste or type in keywords that you find to your .txt that you started. 
3a) each key word should be on it's own line
4) save the .txt and remember it's path.
5) open this project which you've already cloned to your machine.  
6) run this project
7) type or paste in the location of the file you wrote all your keywords into
8) magic
9) your console will  tell  you which words appeared the most frequently and so on.
10) let me know or make an issue if something goes wrong.
